Toying with this command line craps game again hoping to make it functional.

After a hiatus from working on this I am trying to structure this is some way that I don't end up with a mess of spaghetti code.  Need to plan out all the functions and program control flow that I'm going to need for this game to 
function properly.

This is just an experiment with me learning python again and trying to get back into coding after a hiatus.
So I'm just learning python while trying to write a command line Craps game because I love playing craps at the casinos.

I started working on this a few weeks ago but decided to make a repo for it so I don't lose my progress and feel more securer making major changes.

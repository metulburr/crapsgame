This is just an experiment with me learning python again and trying to get back into coding after a hiatus.
So I'm just learning python while trying to write a command line Craps game because I love playing craps at the casinos.

I started working on this a few weeks ago but decided to make a repo for it so I don't lose my progress and feel more securer making major changes.
